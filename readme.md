# Metronome
Created by Brian Sleeper and Jack Amoratis on 5/17/14.
Released into the public domain. We think this is awesome software, but in all humility, there's nothing highly secret going on here. A timer, some sounds being played, some decimals being converted into fractions. That represents the entire functionality of the program. All you need to do is pop in some buttons, labels, and a table into a view and wire it into this code, and you will have your own working variable metronome. If you can make use of this code, then feel free to fork it, or just cut and paste. No warranty is given, and we make no representation that this code is suitable for a particular purpose. Attribution appreciated but not required. This code is public domain. Enjoy!

## License
This is an open source, free app. Anybody can use the app, and anyone can take the source code and do whatever they want with it. The app is a free gift to the world. Use it, rename it, sell it, make a lesson from it, whatever you want. Have fun!

## How it Came to Be
Jack Amoratis wanted to learn how to build iOS Apps. The best way to do that? By actually making an app. So Jack asked a few friends if they had any ideas. When Jack mentioned that he was thinking of making a metronome, a friend who was a music teacher mentioned that some metronomes are variable. There is nothing new about this concept, but not many apps do it so it would be a good challenge. This teacher explained some music theory about metronomes and Jack set about building a variable metronome app. There are already metronomes on the market with this same functionality so Jack looked at their interfaces and translated that into an app paradigm.

## The Future
This project is complete in terms of being a "first take" at an iOS app. It works. It's a "first take" at an iOS app. It is not optimized, so please excuse the jankiness. It was all assembled one tutorial at a time.

It took me about 4 months of occasional evenings and weekends to make it. Along the way, to make this app I learned how to work with the following things in Objective C:

* Delegates
* Properties and methods
* NSString, int, NSDouble, other data types
* Timers
* UITableView and other UI elements such as UIButton, UITextLabel
* Data sources
* UI triggering events, UI receiving output
* Views

And while not in the final version, early versions gave me a change to use:

* Sprites
* SQLite DB
* NSUserDefinedPrefs

After all of this done in 4 months, I could probably now build this same app in about a week because now I have learned how to write objective C, and I am familiar with using all of the things listed above. I would no longer be researching them and figuring them out for the first time. Following that, I think this is a simple app. In a few more months I think I could produce this app in about a day to write, and a day to write / refactor / tweak.
